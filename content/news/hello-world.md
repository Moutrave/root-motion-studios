We are thrilled to officially launch the Root Motion Studios news feed. This is where we will share development updates, behind-the-scenes looks, and thoughts on game design.

## What to Expect

- **Dev logs** from the team working on Suns of the Abyss
- **Design deep-dives** into the creatures, biomes, and systems of our underwater world
- **Studio updates** on milestones, events, and community news

Stay tuned — there is much more to come.
